      'Welcome to Skylight, a Studio Quality Condenser Microphone from 512 Audio',
    product_description:
      'Whether you Podcast, Broadcast, Stream, Play or Produce, 512 Audio’s new Skylight Condenser Microphone delivers the studio quality sound you and your listeners demand. Designed by engineers with a deep passion for audio, Skylight is ready to bring your voice to the world. Let’s begin.',
    header_intro: 'Step into the Skylight',
    product_intro:
      'On the bottom of the microphone is the XLR connector which accepts a standard 3-pin microphone cable for easy, secure connection to your audio mixer, interface or portable recorder. Skylight is a side-address design, which means that it picks up audio coming in to the side of the microphone, not the end. For easy reference, the “front” of the microphone body carries the 512 Audio badge, so just point the side with the badge towards the speaker you’re trying to capture and you’ll be ready to go.',
    header_feature: 'Shock Treatment',
    product_feature:
      'Your Skylight microphone includes an adjustable Shock Mount cradle designed to gracefully suspend the microphone exactly where you need it, which not only looks great but protects your audio from the thumps and booms of stomping feet and table-tapping guests. Simply attach the Shock Mount to your boom arm or mic stand, slip Skylight into place and tighten the bottom ring to snug everything into place. Lastly, connect an XLR mic cable and run it from Skylight to your mixer, interface or portable recorder.',
    header_power: 'I Got the Power',
    product_power:
      'Skylight is a condenser microphone, which contributes to its lush tone and sensitivity. It also means that it requires 48 Volts of external power to operate (which is sometimes referred to as “Phantom Power”). Most USB audio interfaces, modern mixers, and recording devices are equipped with phantom power, which is typically accessible via a switch or button labeled “48V” somewhere near the microphone input or on the front or back panel. (NOTE: Before turning on phantom power, it’s a good idea to turn your speakers down or take off your headphones, as there’s often a bit of a “pop” sound as the power first kicks on.) Once you’re connected and powered on, you’re ready to rock.',

    product_description:
      'Whether you’re Podcasting, Broadcasting, Streaming, Gaming or Recording, the new Limelight dynamic microphone is your key to studio quality sound – no engineering degree needed. Designed by engineers with a deep passion for audio, Limelight is easy to use, built like a tank, and ready to help you bring your voice to the world. So let’s get started.',
    header_intro: 'Have you met Mic?',
    product_intro:
      'Limelight is an end-address microphone, which simply means that you’ll point the business end of the microphone at the sound you’re looking to capture. At the other end, you’ll find the XLR connector which allows you to use a standard 3-pin microphone cable to connect Limelight to your audio mixer, interface or portable recorder. You’ll also find a small switch to control the built-in High Pass Filter on the bottom of the mic. This clever little toggle will allow you to cut out unwanted boominess and rumble (if needed) without having to “Fix It In the Mix” later with EQ.',
    header_feature: 'Is this a Setup?',
    product_feature:
      'Limelight includes an adjustable swivel mount to easily position the microphone exactly where you want it. Simply attach the mount to your microphone stand or boom arm, slip Limelight into the mount and use the tightening knob to get everything nice and snug. Be sure not to over-tighten! Use an XLR microphone cable to connect to your mixer, interface or portable recorder and you’re good to go.',

    product_power:
      'A wonderful bonus of dynamic microphone design is known as the “Proximity Effect.” Not to be confused with a restraining order, the Proximity Effect describes a pleasing boost in the bass or low end of the sound as you move closer to the microphone. This can add a sense of intimacy to a voice and it’s a great way to release your inner FM Disc Jockey.',

    header_gain: 'Gain the Advantage',
    product_gain:
      'Not to be confused with volume, the Gain setting on your mixer, interface or portable recorder can ensure that you’re creating the absolute best – and noise free – signal possible. This magical knob controls how sensitive the microphone is and has a dramatic effect on the quality of the sound that you’ll get. Set it too low, and no one will ever hear a word you’re saying. Set it too high and the microphone will pick up everything from the echo in your room to the air conditioning, your noisy chair, your loud neighbors and the voices in your head. Either way, it’s not ideal. So grab the gain knob, speak and listen. As you turn the gain down, move the microphone closer to your mouth – the volume will stay the same but the sound will dramatically improve. Once you find your happy medium you’ll be on your way. So take a few minutes and experiment with microphone Direction, Distance and Gain. You are your voice and Limelight can help you sound your best.',
    header_pop: 'Ex-ing Your Plosives',
    product_pop:
      'Are you worried about popping Ps and tapping Ts? Voiceover pros often use a pop filter in front of the microphone to take care of unwanted popping sounds, and it remains the most foolproof way to handle these noises. 512 Audio makes an affordable pop filter for just that purpose, which is available wherever 512 products are sold.',

      'Limelight is a Dynamic Microphone with a Hypercardiod* pickup pattern – that means it will primarily “listen” to what it’s pointed at and will largely ignore sounds off to one side or the other. This is a great feature for Podcasters working in the same room with a co-host where each microphone should ideally only pick up one voice. In this case, we suggest placing the microphone 6 – 8 inches from the speaker, pointed as his or her mouth.',
    header_pro_tip: 'pro tip:',
    pro_tip:
      'If you don’t have a pop filter available, you can still minimize popping sounds with a little bit of experimentation. As an exercise, place your hand in front of your face and say the word “pop” over and over. Now move your hand slowly side to side as you speak. While your dog may think you’re losing your mind, you’ll quickly notice that you only feel the puffs of air when your hand is directly in front of your mouth. Simply move the microphone up or to the side - while still pointing it at your mouth - and you’re good to go.',
